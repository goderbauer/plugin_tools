Flutter Plugin Tools implements a CLI with various productivity tools for hosting multiple Flutter plugins in one github
repository. It is mainly used by the [flutter/plugins](https://github.com/flutter/plugins) and
[flutter/flutterfire](https://github.com/flutter/flutterfire) repositories. It was mainly written to facilitate
testing on Travis for these repositories (see [travis.yaml](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml)).

As an example, Flutter Plugin Tools allows you to:

* Build all plugin example apps with one command
* Run the tests of all pluigns with one command
* Format all Dart, Java, and Objective-C code in the repository

## Installation

In order to use the tools you need to enable them once by running the following command:

```shell
$ pub global activate flutter_plugin_tools
```

## Usage

```shell
$ pub global run flutter_plugin_tools <command>
```

Repalce `<command>` with `help` to print a list of available commands.
